# Birthday Notification Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® **Current Issues (August 5th, 9 AM)**

1. **WhatsApp notifications not sent** for Luca Mag's birthday
2. **Frontend not showing** "Today's Birthday" section for Luca Mag

## üîß **Immediate Fixes**

### **1. Trigger WhatsApp Notifications (URGENT)**

**In your Supabase SQL Editor, run:**
```sql
SELECT public.check_todays_birthdays();
```

This will immediately create birthday notification messages for all 9 other group members.

### **2. Check if Messages Were Created**

```sql
SELECT 
  recipient_number,
  template_parameters[1] as recipient_name,
  status,
  created_at
FROM birthday_messages 
WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### **3. Process Pending Messages**

If messages are created but not sent, trigger the processing:

```sql
-- Check pending messages
SELECT COUNT(*) as pending_count 
FROM birthday_messages 
WHERE status = 'pending' AND DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE;

-- If there are pending messages, they should be processed automatically
-- by the Edge Function, but you can also trigger it manually via API
```

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Why Messages Weren't Sent:**

1. **Cron Job Issue**: The scheduled cron job (`0 12 * * *` = 12 PM UTC = 9 AM Buenos Aires) may not have run
2. **Function Not Deployed**: The `check_todays_birthdays()` function might not be properly deployed
3. **Database Connection**: There might be connection issues

### **Why Frontend Not Showing Today's Birthday:**

1. **Timezone Issues**: Browser timezone vs server timezone mismatch
2. **Date Calculation Logic**: The previous logic was using `daysUntil === 0` which can be unreliable

## üõ†Ô∏è **Permanent Fixes**

### **1. Fix Cron Job**

Check if the cron job exists and is active:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE command LIKE '%check_todays_birthdays%';
```

If it doesn't exist, recreate it:

```sql
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'birthday-reminder-check',
  '0 12 * * *', -- 12 PM UTC = 9 AM Buenos Aires (UTC-3)
  'SELECT public.check_todays_birthdays();'
);
```

### **2. Test the Function**

Test the birthday function manually:

```sql
-- Test for today's birthdays
SELECT 
  gm.id,
  gm.name,
  gm.birthday,
  g.name as group_name
FROM public.group_members gm
JOIN public.groups g ON gm.group_id = g.id
WHERE 
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM gm.birthday) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM CURRENT_DATE)
  AND EXTRACT(DAY FROM gm.birthday) = EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_DATE);
```

### **3. Frontend Fix**

The frontend has been updated to use a more reliable `isBirthdayToday()` function that:
- Compares month and day only (ignores year)
- Avoids timezone issues
- Is more reliable than the previous `daysUntil === 0` logic

## üìä **Expected Results**

### **For WhatsApp Notifications:**
- **9 messages** should be created (10 members - 1 birthday person)
- **Recipients**: All group members except Luca Mag
- **Template**: "birthday_alert_arg" with parameters [recipient_name, "Luca Mag", "35"]

### **For Frontend Display:**
- **Special "Today's Birthday" section** should appear
- **Luca Mag** should be highlighted with üéÇ and üéâ emojis
- **Orange/yellow gradient** styling

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Immediately**: Run the manual trigger SQL
2. **Check**: Verify messages were created
3. **Deploy**: Deploy the frontend changes
4. **Monitor**: Check if the cron job runs tomorrow
5. **Test**: Test with another birthday to ensure it works

## üìû **If Issues Persist**

1. Check Supabase logs for errors
2. Verify Edge Functions are running
3. Check database permissions
4. Verify WhatsApp API credentials
5. Test with a different birthday date
