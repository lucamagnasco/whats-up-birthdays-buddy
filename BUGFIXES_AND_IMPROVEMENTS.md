# Bug Fixes and Improvements - December 2024

## ✅ **COMPLETED** - All Issues Fixed

### 1. **Fixed 404 Error for Configuration Button** ✅

#### **Issue**
- Configuration button (gear icon) in group detail page was trying to navigate to `/groups/${id}/settings`
- This route doesn't exist, causing a 404 error

#### **Solution**
- **File**: `src/pages/GroupDetail.tsx`
- **Change**: Redirected configuration button to `/profile` page instead
- **Code**:
  ```typescript
  // Before
  onClick={() => navigate(`/groups/${id}/settings`)}
  
  // After  
  onClick={() => navigate('/profile')}
  ```

#### **Impact**
- ✅ Configuration button now works correctly
- ✅ Users can access profile settings from group detail page
- ✅ No more 404 errors

### 2. **Improved Group Creation Modal** ✅

#### **Issues Addressed**
1. "Complete your profile" section should be red (was yellow)
2. "Share your group" section should only have two buttons (was cluttered)
3. Remove "Group details" section entirely

#### **Solutions**
